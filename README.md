# LangPic
A simple React app that lets you practice speaking a foreign language by recording yourself describing photos.

## Should I use it?
It works great for finding words, phrases and situations you didn't realize you didn't know yet. For example if you want to say "There are 10 rocks balanced in the shape of a triangle", you may suddenly realize you don't know the word for `triangle` or `balanced` and then you can go create some new flash cards. 

One additional benefit is listening back to your own recordings often makes pronunciation issues obvious.

I'm still not sure if it improves speaking ability long term. I created this early last year as one of my first experiments with language learning. I now believe listening and reading are the most natural way to learn a language, with speaking ability coming as a result of fluency in those two areas.
